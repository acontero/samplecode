Instructions to run:

For my code you have to run the main in MainServer first and then run the main in Client. 
And then in Eclipse if you click on the console button on the right, you can alternate between views of both outputs/consoles.  
But you probably already know that.

There will be errors at the very bottom of one of the consoles which I sort of addressed in my email to you.
