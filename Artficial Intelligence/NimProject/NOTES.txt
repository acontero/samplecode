Setup function
	Generate a new "gameboard" condition

XOR function - (Steve) 
	calculate if the current state is a winning or losing state
	Will use this function to determine the current state of the board when it's your turn and also 
	to determine whether each possible move is winning or losing
	
DecisionTree function, returns Decision (which stack and how many)
	determine the optimal move using a heuristic function from all the possible moves in the current row of alpha-beta pruning tree
	Will need to build a tree...
	There are three main branches for each turn, each branch corresponds to one of the three stacks:
		Each branch branches off further in considering all possible number of muffins to take from the particular branch at hand
	
	NOTE: if you are in a winning state, the tree should get all possible moves that will create a losing state for your opponent 
	(use the XOR function) and then choose from among those (this would be an OPTIMAL MOVE)
	IN PRUNING TREE: we may just stop searching once we find a move that will result ina losing state
