README for Contero.A.HW3

To compile these programs in Eclipse, go to Run-->Run Configurations, select Main as the main class for this project, 
then in the arguments tab type "input.txt" followed by "output.txt" (in quotations).  It should look like this in the arguments text box:

"input.txt" "output.txt"

When you run the program you'll see a series of records (from the testing data), the correct prediction and the decision tree's prediction.
Sometimes the decision tree prediction will be empty and it will look like this in the output file:

buyingPrice = 0  maintPrice = 0  doors = 0  persons = 0  lug_boot = 0  safety = 2  acceptabilityClass = 0  
Answer is supposed to be: unacc
Answer is actually: 
Prediction was: false

If you see this, please run the program until you get a value for "Answer is actually"
Then scroll to the bottom for a list of accuracies for each percentage of learningData.

The results are in my report as well.
