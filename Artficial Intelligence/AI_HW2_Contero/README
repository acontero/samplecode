README for Contero.A.HW2

To compile these programs in Eclipse, go to Run-->Run Configurations, select Main as the main class for this project, 
then in the arguments tab include which of the input files you'd like to run in quotations as such: "hw2dataset_10.txt" 
followed by "output.txt" (also in quotations).  It should look like this in the arguments text box:

"hw2dataset_10.txt" "output.txt"

The code is set up to run the initial test parameters you gave in the instructions.  If you'd like to run one of the 
sets of parameters I made, you will have to comment out the current parameters and uncomment out one of the other sets.
The parameters are at the beginning of the program.

Thanks!
