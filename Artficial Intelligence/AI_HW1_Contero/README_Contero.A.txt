README for Contero.A.HW1

To compile these programs in Eclipse, go to Run-->Run Configurations, select the algorithm class you'd like to run as the main method, then in the arguments tab include "input.txt" and "output.txt" so that the input can be read and the results outputted into the appropriate text files included in the project.

PLEASE NOTE: For some reason my IDA* algorithm is only working properly for the easy puzzle. For the rest of the puzzles, I am getting a null pointer exception in the for loop condition check below. I ran of time before I was able to debug this. To see the results for the first puzzle, please cut the other puzzles out of the input before running this algorithm.  Otherwise, you will not see any output at all.  Well actually if you wait long enough like I did, it go to the 100-something step but I couldn't scroll up in my output file to see anything else.

Thanks!
