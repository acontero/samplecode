On here you'll find the following folders of programs, organized by language or, in the case of AI and Distributed Systems, by course:

Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2013 - these include my write-ups on each of the projects:
1) HW1 - Implemented A* Algorithm to solve a series of 8-puzzle games
2) HW2 - A program using Bayesian networks to learn missing data
3) HW3 - Implemented Decision Tree Algorithm to model data from an online source.
4) Nim Project - final project for this course for which I worked in a group, recreating the famous Nim Game. There is code for 2 possible strategies for the computer.  I have also included the .jar file to view the interactive GUI my group member created for the grade, based on the first strategy.

Distributed Systems (Fall 2013):
1) Project1 - Enacted a program that followed a narrative about visitors at Ellis Island attending 3 different lectures, each with Q&A sessions, speakers and a clock.  Each visitor tries to get into a movie session and when the session is maxed out, they try to get into another one.  This implementation makes use of monitors.
2) Project2 - Implemented the same narrative as above, only this time with a multi-threaded server.

Python (assignments from the Advanced Programming Techniques Course I'm taking Spring 2014):
1) longest.py 
   finds the longest path within a binary tree
2) mergesort.py
   performs the algorithm for mergesort on a given list
3) qselect.py
   Quick Select with Randomized Pivot
   Here, we are looking for the i-th smallest value in list a.
   This method returns that value.
   NOTE: assumes the values are distinct
4) qsort.py
   Working with a function that returns a tree with []'s representing the nodes and sub-tree, built on top of this, a search function, an insert function and a sorted function (which returns the numbers in the tree, sorted)

Objective-C (while interning at TeliApp Summer 2012):
1) iBox_initNetworkCommunication:  One of the methods I wrote for the app I created called iBox Remote File Access.  
This boolean method creates a connection to the server (which in the case of this app, is your home PC) and returns true if connection is successful and false otherwise.  I am not usually so stingy on code comments, but hopefully this is easy enough to follow.  

C++ (these were hw assignments during my Algorithmic Problem Solving in C++ course from Spring 2012):
1) memoized fibonacci program 
2) recursive 8 queens program 
3) shortestPath program 
4) stable marriage program 

Java (these were assignments during my Data Structures course from Fall 2012):
1) Data Structures Project 1 - a program that takes in two large numbers, saves each into separate linked lists and then performs multiplication on the two large numbers and outputs the product. 
2) Data Structures Project 2 - a program that takes in a list of numbers and outputs a binary tree of those numbers. (This was an assignment during my Data Structures course from Fall 2012)
3) Data Structures Project 3 - a program that does the Chromatic Number problem. It colors a graph in such a way that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. (This was an assignment during my Data Structures course from Fall 2012)
